<h1>About me...</h1>
<p>Coming from a family of army men, a boy with patriotic thoughts and techy interests, who want to live life like iron
 man and believe in love and respect for women. Hi myself Abhishek Singh, and this is my brief introduction, as I am not 
 much good at writing but still trying my best...<br><br>
I am originally from Basti, Uttarpradesh, but ss my father is in BSF, I had spent my early childhood in Jaiselmer, Rajasthan, 
and childhood in Tripura. Where Jaiselmer a prosperous city to Agartala a place where I had seen extreme poverty, some people
 who come to ous quarters as labours and kamwali, just take meal once in a day. Seeing these things makes me do something for 
 them, just somehow I could help them. My mother used to give them our old clothes and food which is very satisfying for me
 but still, your heart will question you how they are living there life, at one side where we just for our showoff spent thousands 
 on branded products and all, other side these people just pray to have enough money to get meal next day too for there family.<br><br>
okay now moving forwards, I returned to my home town due to transfer of my father at tough location where keeping family with you
 is not allowed. So I spent my teenage life in Basti again making new friends.This journey of making new friends and at last leaving
 them goes on,but the only friend who is with me always is my sister my best friend, and now far away from my father because till now 
 I never live away from him and it is really very difficult for me and my family too, but as time goes on we got habitual with it. Here 
 I had completed my 10th and I went to Kota!!<br>
Ya, of course for JEE, the dream of my childhood and obviously perfect place for technology lovers. And I Made into it and then I come 
to IIT Kharagpur.
And a new life started....<br><br>
